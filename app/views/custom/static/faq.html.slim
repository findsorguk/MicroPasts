          |So who can list projects on MicroPasts?
        dd
          |Anyone who wishes to propose a project about archaeology, history or heritage may do so as long as the project is conducted by a mixed team including: (a) at least one archaeology, history or heritage professional, and (b) at least one other interested member of the public. At present, we will vet all proposed projects to ensure that this is the case, but we are happy to hear suggestions about alternatives.

          |I'm an interested member of the public and have an idea for an archaeology, history or heritage project for which I would like to seek funding. However, I'm not affiliated to an academic institution and don’t have an institutional partner to team up with. What should I do?
        dd
          |On the MicroPasts crowd-funding platform you are able to fundraise only for projects that will be conducted jointly by community (e.g. people already belonging to volunteer historical and archaeological societies, or individual members of the public wth a particular interest) and institutional partners (e.g. universities, museums). If you don’t know any archaeology, history or heritage professional to team up with, we might be able to help you find one, so do get in touch!

          |Does MicroPasts retain any of my contribution?
        dd In order to keep the servers running and keep the site sustainable over the longer term, we will retain 1% of contributions made on the platform. This percentage is meant to cover base costs rather than create any profit for MicroPasts from year to year and the exact level is something we will scrutinise and discussopenly on the community forum. If you feel that a different level of contribution to running costs is viable and more appropriate, please do make it known on the MicroPasts community forum!
